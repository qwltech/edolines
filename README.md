# EDO Lines
JI versus various EDOs

The purpose of this chart is to give a visual comparison of how the intervals of just intonation compare with various EDOs (Equal Divisions of the Octave). The colored lines represent just intonation, and the thick black lines represent various EDOs.

## Wish List

- Ability to dynamically generate this chart according to user-selected parameters
- parameter: max interval complexity by prime limit
- parameter: max interval complexity by number of prime factors
- parameter: list of EDOs to compare
- ability to generate a huge list of rational numbers, assign them to prime limit bins, and sort each bin
- etc.
